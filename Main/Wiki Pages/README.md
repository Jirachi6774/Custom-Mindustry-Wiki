This folder contains everything but instead of everything being smashed together in one document, each thing has its own special <code title="Hyper Text Markup Langue" class="help">.html</code> file.<br>
The <code title="Hyper Text Markup Langue" class="help">.html</code> files are still ordered and categorized in their type folder of in which category they belong inside of.<br>

The main <code title="Hyper Text Markup Langue" class="help">.html</code> file will be the <code title="Table Of Contents" class="help">TOC</code> for all the pages.<br>
There will be a lot of work on each document.<br>
> You may be reading this when it is temporary be done

Please do not remove this folder out from the parent folder!<br>
These documents also use the files (the image assets) that are inside of the parent folder called <code>"Mindustry Wiki"</code> which is the parent of the folder with assets.<br>
These assist out of that folder are needed for the separate pages as making a copy of all the assets will just take up more space, this isn't good as the project is already quite big.<br>

If you have read this document, thank you and happy reading.<br>
